# Build-in Themes

In Mainsail, there are two groups that are permitted to have build-in themes. The first group consists of all vendor sponsors, who receive exclusive themes as a recognition of their support. The second group includes large open source communities.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a maintainer of a large open-source 3d printing project, please contact the Mainsail crew on the Discord server for a build-in theme.
{% endhint %}
