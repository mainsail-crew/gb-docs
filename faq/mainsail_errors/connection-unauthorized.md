  The 'Unauthorized' error often occurs with VPN connections or specific network
  configurations. It means Mainsail is not permitted to connect to the Moonraker
  API. Follow this guide to fix this issue.

Moonraker uses the `trusted_clients` list in the `[authorization]` section of its configuration to specify IP addresses authorized to connect to the API. You need to identify the allowed IP range and add it to this list. To check which IP addresses are requesting access to Moonraker, you can review the `moonraker.log` file. Look at the end of the `moonraker.log` file (this file should be located at `~/printer_data/logs/moonraker.log`) and you should find these lines:

```

```

In the first line, you can see the client IP that attempted to connect. In this case, the IP address is `192.168.0.31`.

Next, you need to add the IP address or IP range to the `moonraker.conf` file. To allow an entire network, use [CIDR notation](https://cidr.xyz/) in the configuration file. For the example IP range above, enter `192.168.0.0/24`, which will permit all clients with IPs from `192.168.0.1` to `192.168.0.254` to connect to Moonraker. You can make these changes via SSH or by using an SFTP program like FileZilla. The `[authorization]` section should now look like this:

```yaml
[authorization]
trusted_clients:
    10.0.0.0/8
    127.0.0.0/8
    169.254.0.0/16
    172.16.0.0/12
    FE80::/10
    ::1/128
    192.168.0.0/24
cors_domains:
    *.lan
    *.local
    *://my.mainsail.xyz
```
