# Installation

## Local installation <a href="#local-installation" id="local-installation"></a>

### MainsailOS

_<mark style="color:red;">recommended for Raspberry Pi users</mark>_

MainsailOS is a prebuilt image for single board computers that already includes Mainsail, Moonraker and Klipper. The least amount of setup.

### KIAUH - _Klipper Installation And Update Helper_
